# Bike-MAR-Gration

As part of the lecture "Data Integration" at the University of Marburg Bela Schinke and Jakob L. MÃ¼ller launched the (Next)Bike Mar(burg) (inte)gration project.

This document will given an overview over the steps taken, technologies used and the goal we want to archive.

## Structure

This data integration project has four components: preparation, data integration, data cleaning, and showcase.

- `data`: This folder explains how we obtained the underlying data. We describe the data pools as well as why and how we use the data.

- `preparation`: Code to extract and load the datasets into a MySQL Database. Here we also do some selections, transformation and perform basic cleaning

- `integration`: We perform On-Line integration. The folder includes some of the used queries and information how the different sources are integrated on varying request.

- `prediction-training`: Experiments to use the integrated dataset to predict bike distribution changes.

- `web-showcase`: Code to run the interactive web app and use the integration pipeline.

- `presentations`: Milestone presentations in the context of the course

## Documentation

### Running the dev version locally
First init node.js
```
cd web-showcase
npm install
```
Then start the tailwind watcher and node server
```
npx tailwindcss -i ./input.css -o ./assets/css/tw.css --watch
```
```
npm run dev
```
This will start a server listening on localhost:3000 which auto updates/restarts on changes

### Using the trained model in production
We use the tensorflowjs python library to converted the trained model for web usage. See the [official tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/js/tutorials/conversion/import_saved_model). For us, a clean python 3.11.4 was used

Command for conversion, execute in a shell an root level
```
tensorflowjs_converter ./prediction-training/models/MODEL-NAME ./web-showcase/assets/model --input_format=tf_saved_model --output_node_names=web-model
```
