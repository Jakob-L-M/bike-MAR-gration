# Bike-MAR-Gration

As part of the lecture "Data Integration" at the University of Marburg Bela Schinke and Jakob L. MÃ¼ller launched the (Next)Bike Mar(burg) (inte)gration project.

This document will given an overview over the steps taken, technologies used and the goal we want to archive.

## Structure

This data integration project has four components: preparation, data integration, data cleaning, and showcase.

- `data`: This folder explains how we obtained the underlying data. We describe the data pools as well as why and how we use the data.

- `preperation`: Code to extract and load the datasets into a MySQL Database. Here we also do some selections, transformation and perform basic cleaning

- `integration`: We perform On-Line integration. The folder includes some of the used queries and information how the different sources are integrated on varying request.

- `prediction-training`: Experiments to use the integrated dataset to predict bike distribution changes.

- `web-showcase`: Code to run the interactive web app and use the integration pipeline.

## Documentation

All code documentation and instructions should be placed in this `README.md`;
